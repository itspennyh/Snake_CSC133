# Snake_CSC133

Update #1: Created Lava, an extension of Apple class, as an obstacle that will end the game (kill the snake) if the player runs into it.
Need to: work on group spawning for the Lava objects so that the Lava spawns in clusters instead of only one at a time, 
         make sure Lava spawns do not overlap with the any of the apple spawns
