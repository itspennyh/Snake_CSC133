# Snake_CSC133

Created a second Apple object, RottenApple, within the original Apple class. RottenApple extends the Apple class within Apple.java and generates its own bitmap for the new RottenApple image, rottenapple.png.

RottenApple randomly spawns within the game screen like a regular apple, but will decrease the body of the snake by 1 or end the game (kill the snake) if the snake is only comprised of the head and no body portions. 

RottenApple will spawn and stay in the same place until it is eaten, then it will respawn into a new location.

There is currently no sound aspect or score change associated with eaten a RottenApple.
